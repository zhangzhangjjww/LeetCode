Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of â€™1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

For example, the 32-bit integer â€™11' has binary representation 00000000000000000000000000001011, so the function should return 3.



class Solution {
public:
    int hammingWeight(uint32_t n) {
        int re=0;
        for(int i=0;i!=32;++i) {
            int key=(n>>i)&1;
            if(key==1) {
                ++re;
            }
        }
        return re;
    }
};
